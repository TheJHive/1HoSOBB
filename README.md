# 1 Hour of Silence Occasionally Broken By...
So you know those videos that are just an hour of silence with random sound effects injected into them?  
Yeah this is a really dumb script I made to open a buttload of them at once and proceed to both kill your sanity and your RAM if you use Chrome like I do.  
Why do this? I don't know myself either.
